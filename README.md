# NamTrainerExtensions
Extensions for the Neural Amp Modeler Trainer

## How to use
Each folder or `.py` file in this repo is an _extension_ that can be installed 
separately to customize [the NAM trainer](). To install an extension, simply 
make a folder under your home directory (usually something like
`/home/username/` on macOS or `C:\\Users\\username\\` on Windows), and copy the
extension you want to install into that folder.
