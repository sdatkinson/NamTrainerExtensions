# NamTrainerExtensions
Extensions for the Neural Amp Modeler Trainer

## How to use
Each folder or `.py` file in the `extensions/` folder in this repo is an _extension_ that can be installed separately to customize [the NAM trainer](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler) (requires version 0.9 or later!). 
To install an extension, simply make a folder under your home directory (usually something like `/home/username/` on macOS or `C:\Users\username\` on Windows), called `.neural-amp-modeler/extensions` and copy the extension you want to install into that folder. 
(If you want to install them all, then just copy the `extensions/` folder.)

That's it! The extension will be used next time you start the GUI or full trainer using the `nam` or `nam-full` command.
